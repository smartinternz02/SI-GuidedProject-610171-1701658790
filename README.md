FetalAI: Using Machine Learning to predict and monitor
Fetal Health

Reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable
Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.The UN expects that by
2030, countries end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age,
with all countries aiming to reduce under 5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000
live births. Parallel to the notion of child mortality is of course maternal mortality, which
accounts for 295 000 deaths during and following pregnancy and childbirth (as of 2017).
The vast majority of these deaths (94%) occurred in low-resource settings, and most
could have been prevented.In light of what was mentioned above, Cardiotocograms
(CTGs) are a simple and cost accessible option to assess fetal health, allowing
healthcare professionals to take action in order to prevent child and maternal mortality.
The equipment itself works by sending ultrasound pulses and reading its response, thus
shedding light on fetal heart rate (FHR), fetal movements, uterine contractions and
more. In this project, we have some characteristics of Fetal Health as a dataset. The
target variable of this dataset is Fetal Health. Since it is a multi class classification, the
classes are represented by ‘Normal’, ‘Pathological’ and ‘Suspect’.

A Fetal Health classification project can have a variety of business requirements in the
healthcare sector depending on the specific goals and objectives of the project.
The business requirement for fetal health classification typically arises in the healthcare
industry, specifically in the obstetrics and gynecology (OB/GYN) department. The
classification of fetal health is necessary to ensure the well-being of the unborn baby
and to make informed decisions regarding pregnancy management.
There are several reasons why a healthcare provider may need to classify fetal health.
For example, fetal health classification can be used to identify fetuses at risk of preterm
labor, intrauterine growth restriction, or other medical conditions that could require early
intervention or special care. Additionally, fetal health classification can help healthcare
providers monitor the health of the fetus during pregnancy, identify any abnormalities or
complications that may arise, and make informed decisions regarding delivery.
In order to classify fetal health, healthcare providers typically use a variety of tools and
techniques, including ultrasound, fetal monitoring, and other diagnostic tests. Machine
learning and artificial intelligence algorithms can also be used to help classify fetal
health based on various parameters such as heart rate, movement, and other
physiological measures. These techniques can help healthcare providers to make more
accurate and timely diagnosis and treatment decisions, leading to better health
outcomes for both the mother and baby.
